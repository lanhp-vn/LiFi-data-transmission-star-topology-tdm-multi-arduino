'Santa Claus is coming to town' Parody
FINALS WEEK IS COMING TO TOWN
You better not cram, you better not cry,
Better not procrastinate, I'm telling you why,
Finals week is coming to town.
We're making our notes, checking them twice,
Gonna find out who's studied or rolled the dice,
Finals week is coming to town.
We see you when you're sleeping,
We know when you're awake,
We know if you've been bad or good,
So be good for goodness sake!
With essays and exams so tight,
Awake in the library all night,
Finals week is coming to town.
